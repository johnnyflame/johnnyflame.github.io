One of the reasons I was drawn to the career path of a software developer is that it is a field that encourages continuous learning and growth. With that said, sometimes this can get a little overwhelming with the amount of knowledge out there. During the first year in the professional career. Fueled by the drive to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, I had a constant problem of setting ambitious reading goals on a wide range of topics, only to get distracted by the next shiny new thing on the radar. 

Given this problem, I've decided to take a more methodic approach to learning, and make a mind map of areas I would like to do better at in 2021.
