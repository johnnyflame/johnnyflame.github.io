One of the reasons I was drawn to the career path of a software developer is that it is a field that encourages continuous learning and growth. With that said, sometimes this can get a little overwhelming with the amount of knowledge out there. 

<!-- A personal proud moment for me -->

During the first year in the professional career. Fueled by the drive to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, I had a constant problem of setting ambitious reading goals on a wide range of topics, only to get distracted by the next shiny new thing on the radar. 

Given this problem, I've decided to take a more methodic approach to learning, and make a roadmap of areas I would like to improve myself in.
