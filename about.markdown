Hi there! I'm Johnny, nice to meet you. I'm a software engineer and a musician from New Zealand, currently living in Sweden. In this blog I'll write about new and interesting topics I come across from day to day, many will be related to my journey working in the software industry, but also other things I'm passionate about, such as music, and food.
